               <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>

               <div class="half-width">

                  <p>I was a 6th grade science teacher for 6 years in NYC. My last 1.5 years of teaching was done remotely. While I taught online, my favorite tool to use was Minecraft Education Edition. I raised $600 to get the game deployed on all of my students' Chromebooks. As I used the game, I began to realize I throughouly enjoyed creating lessons and building worlds and using code in the game to do it. This is where my journey into tech started.</p>

               <div class="half-width">

                  <p>In September 2021, my husband and I decided to leave New York and start a life of travel. I knew that remote teaching wouldn't last forever, so I decided to follow my passion for creating and pursued front-end web development. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized just how many skills are transferable from teaching to tech.</p>

                  <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>

                  <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                  <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>

                  <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
